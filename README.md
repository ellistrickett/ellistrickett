I am an ambitious and determined Makers Academy graduate, confident in TDD using both JavaScript and Ruby. I took the decision to pursue a career in Software Development because I love the process of bringing ideas to life and learning new skills each and every day. Makers has proven to be the perfect place to start my journey and learn the skills needed to become successful in the industry, such as Object Oriented Design principles, the ability to learn any new technology I wish and working in team environment utilising Agile methodologies.

Since graduating Makers at the end of June, I have juggled my time between job searching and learning new technologies. I have made use of this time by becoming an even better developer and learning new technologies which will stand me in good stead for when I do get my first opportunity. I feel I have mastered the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) and am now challenging myself to build projects using Python. I love playing around with new technologies and feel it hugely benifits my core understanding of how Software Development works.

# Background

Before I decided to pursue a career in tech, I had been working in various sales roles for 7+ years. 3 years ago I moved to London in order to further my career and was working as a customer-facing sales executive in the lucrative conference industry. I built relationships with C-Level executives across multiple industries and specialised in Pharmaceutical Development. I was successful and went above and beyond targets due to my work ethic and determination to succeed.

**Tech Stack**: JavaScript, Ruby, Python, React, Vue.js, Nodejs, Express, Django, Rails, MongoDB, SQL, HTML, CSS, Sinatra, Bootstrap, Rspec, Postman, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress

# Skills

#### Excellent Communicator

In previous roles, my job has always centred around healthy discussion. Whether it is meeting with the sales team to discuss different approaches to campaigns or speaking one on one with clients to find out how we can help them achieve their business goals. Communication has always been key to any succes I have had. 

At Makers it was no different, working in teams of 4-6 on projects planning sprints and problem solving on the go, it has been essential to hear everyones point of view in order to learn from others and overcome hurdles along the way.

#### Problem Solver

Problem solving is one of my favourite aspects of coding. I love getting stuck into a bug or implementing functionality that I am new to. For me it is the most important part of the learning process as I know whilst I am trying to solve the issue, no time is wasted because I am simultaneously learning more about the code or tech I am working with. Of course once I do eventually fix the bug or implement the new functionality, I feel great and know where I went wrong, so I can make sure next time I am faced with a simlar problem I will know what to do.

In my previous role, I was problem solving all day. Calling clients, finding out about their business plans and offering bespoke solutions to help them improve. If the solution did not match their needs specifically or if I did not handle an objective correctly then that would be the end of the discussion. It was all about finding out as much about the client as possible, so that we could find the right piece in the jigsaw and help them succeed.

#### InquisitiveÂ 

I love learning new things and Software Development gives me the opportunity to do this for the rest of my career. If it is a new piece of syntax or a different approach to a problem, I don't leave any stone unturned. I want to learn everthing there is to know about whatever it is I am working on, right down to the finest details. It may mean it might take longer to complete a task first time around, but I want to be confident when I have completed said task, that I can replicate this going forward with minimal fuss. 

This is why when I finished Makers, I decided to take a few months to carry on learning as opposed to diving straight into the job hunt. I felt there was things I missed out on first time around. I wanted to make sure when I do come to applying for jobs, I am 100% confident I have grasped key concepts and I can build a full stack website on my own as opposed to part of a team. I can now and this is why I am ready to take the next step in my journey!

# Hobbies

I have been skateboarding for over 15 years now. It is one of the most important things in my life and I owe it alot. From a young age, it taught me how to see the world creatively and how to push myself to achieve goals.

I am also a keen runner and cyclist in my spare time. I find it helps to keep the mind energised and ready to code.
